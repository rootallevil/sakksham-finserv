            The expert team at Sakksham Finserv LLP delivers reliable and
            well-structured credit collection services to financial institutions
            across India. Leveraging our experience in managing early-stage
            overdue accounts, we support banks, NBFCs, and co-operative
            societies in recovering outstanding dues before they progress into
            defaults. Our services span a broad range of credit products,
            including________.

          <p>
            We understand that each client has specific operational needs and
            challenges. Accordingly, we tailor our credit collection process to
            suit individual requirements. Our team conducts regular follow-ups
            and, when necessary, carries out field visits to engage directly
            with borrowers. At Sakksham Finserv, our goal is to support timely
            repayments, reduce the risk of default, and assist our clients in
            managing their credit portfolios more effectively.
