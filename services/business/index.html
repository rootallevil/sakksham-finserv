            To ensure greater Financial Inclusion and increase the outreach of
            the BFSI sector, the banks, NBFC and Credit Co-Op Society started
            giving permits to some agents that will be present at various
            places/jurisdiction and act as intermediaries in providing some
            Banking services through the use of the Business Correspondent Model
            (BC Model). One of the most significant advantages of the BC model
            is its potential to drive financial inclusion by providing access to
            banking services to population groups that have traditionally been
            excluded; by providing banking services through BCs, banks can help
            to close these gaps and bring more people into the financial system.
            BC model is its potential to reduce the cost of banks.
